Error Message:
"Failed to build ios project. 'xcodebuild' exited with error code '65'."

Context:
- Occurred after running `npx react-native run-ios` on a React Native project.
- Project recently cleaned and pods reinstalled.
- Error 65 is a generic Xcode build failure, often requiring diagnosis in Xcode.

Diagnosis Steps:
1. Opened the project in Xcode using `open ios/CookingApp.xcworkspace`.
2. Attempted to build in Xcode to view detailed error logs.
3. Review the Issue Navigator in Xcode for specific error details.

Next Steps for Resolution:
- Check for missing or incompatible pods: Run `pod install` in the `ios` directory.
- Clean the build folder in Xcode: Product > Clean Build Folder (⇧⌘K).
- Check signing & capabilities: Ensure team and signing certificate are set correctly in project settings.
- Check for incompatible Swift/Obj-C versions or module import errors.
- Check for missing Info.plist keys or duplicate symbols.

Notes:
- Once the specific error is identified in Xcode, document the solution here for future reference.

Update (2024-06-09):

Specific Xcode Error:
- ReactCodegen: Command PhaseScriptExecution failed with a nonzero exit code.

Solution Steps Taken:
1. Cleaned all build artifacts, node_modules, and pods using `react-native-clean-project`.
2. Reinstalled all JS dependencies with `npm install`.
3. Reinstalled CocoaPods with `pod install` in the `ios` directory.

This is a common React Native issue, often caused by stale or corrupted build artifacts or codegen outputs. Cleaning and reinstalling dependencies usually resolves it. If the error persists, check for:
- Sufficient disk space
- Correct Node.js version (use LTS recommended by React Native)
- No custom modifications to codegen scripts
- Xcode and CocoaPods are up to date

If the problem continues, open the full build log in Xcode for more details and check for any additional script errors or permission issues.
