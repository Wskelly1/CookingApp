- **Error Handling Workflow**
  - Whenever an error is encountered during development or automation:
    - Check the `encountered_errors/` folder for a log file describing a similar error and the fix that worked previously.
    - If a matching or similar error is found, attempt the documented fix before trying other solutions.
    - If the error is new or the fix does not resolve the issue, research and attempt a new fix.
    - After resolving the error (or attempting a fix), create or update a log file in `encountered_errors/` with:
      - The error message and context
      - The fix or attempted fix
      - The date/time of occurrence
      - Any additional notes or observations
  - This process ensures that recurring errors are resolved more quickly and that the knowledge base of fixes grows over time.

- **Example:**
  - If an Android build fails with an ADB or emulator error, check for a log in `encountered_errors/` describing a similar issue and apply the fix before troubleshooting from scratch.

- **Best Practices:**
  - Keep error logs concise but detailed enough to be actionable.
  - Use clear filenames that reflect the error type or context (e.g., `android_build_error_log.txt`).
  - Regularly review and clean up outdated or irrelevant error logs.

- **Purpose**
  - Document all encountered errors, their causes, and resolutions.
  - Ensure error logs and documentation are reviewed and actionable.
  - Provide a reference for recurring or critical errors to improve project stability.

- **Usage**
  - Add entries for each new error encountered during development or production.
  - Link to relevant code, logs, or documentation.
  - Update with resolution steps and prevention strategies.
