Implement ingredient list with quantities and optional substitutions using ListView.builder or similar Flutter components. Create tool list with visual indicators using appropriate Flutter UI elements. Implement step-by-step instruction display with progress tracking using StatefulWidget. Add estimated time and difficulty level indicators with Flutter's visual components. Create UI for saving recipe to Cookbook using Flutter's state management solution. Implement share functionality for recipes using Flutter's share package.
