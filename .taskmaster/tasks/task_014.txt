# Task ID: 14
# Title: Audio Instruction System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 8, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement audio playback for recipe instructions and assistant responses
# Details:
Research and integrate text-to-speech library for Flutter. Create audio service for converting text instructions to speech. Implement playback controls (play, pause, repeat). Add voice speed adjustment feature. Create audio queue for sequential instruction playback. Implement background audio capability for continued playback when app is minimized. Add error handling for audio playback failures.

# Test Strategy:
Test audio playback of various instruction types. Verify playback controls work correctly. Test background audio functionality. Ensure proper error handling for playback failures. Use Flutter's testing framework for unit and widget tests.
