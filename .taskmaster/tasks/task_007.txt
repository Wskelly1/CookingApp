# Description: Implement user profile screen with ability to view and edit personal information and preferences
# Details:
Create profile screen with user information display using Flutter widgets. Implement edit functionality for all profile fields with Flutter form components. Create UI for updating cooking experience, dietary restrictions, and food preferences using Flutter's material design components. Implement profile picture upload and management using Flutter image picker and file handling. Add settings section for app preferences (notifications, theme) using Flutter's ThemeData and notification plugins. Connect profile updates to Supabase database using the supabase_flutter package. Implement local storage for offline profile access using shared_preferences or hive.

# Test Strategy:
Test viewing and editing all profile fields using Flutter widget tests and integration tests. Verify changes are persisted to the database using mock Supabase services. Test profile picture upload and display with Flutter's TestWidgets. Ensure profile data is available offline through local storage tests.
