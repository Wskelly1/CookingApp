# Task ID: 13
# Title: Cookbook Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the personal cookbook feature for saving and organizing favorite recipes
# Details:
Design Cookbook screen with saved recipe display using Flutter widgets. Implement recipe saving functionality with local storage (shared_preferences or Hive) and Supabase sync. Create categorization system for organizing recipes. Implement search and filter functionality within Cookbook using Flutter's search delegates. Add recipe editing and notes feature with Flutter forms. Create UI for viewing recipe history and favorites using Flutter's Material or Cupertino design components. Implement offline access to saved recipes using local database solutions like Hive or SQLite.

Test saving recipes to Cookbook from various app locations using Flutter widget tests and integration tests. Verify recipes are available offline with Flutter Driver tests. Test categorization and organization features. Ensure sync works correctly when returning online after offline changes using mocked Supabase responses.
