# Task ID: 8
# Title: LLM API Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2
# Priority: high
# Description: Integrate OpenAI or similar LLM API for the 'Hey Chef' assistant functionality
# Details:
Research and select appropriate LLM API (OpenAI, etc.). Create API service for LLM communication. Implement prompt engineering for recipe sourcing based on ingredients and tools. Create response parsing for structured recipe data. Implement error handling and retry logic for API failures. Set up caching mechanism for common queries to reduce API calls. Create fallback responses for when the API is unavailable.

# Test Strategy:
Test API integration with various ingredient and tool combinations. Verify response parsing correctly extracts recipe information. Test error handling with simulated API failures. Measure response times and optimize as needed.
