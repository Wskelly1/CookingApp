# Task ID: 22
# Title: Error Handling and Feedback System
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 5, 8, 11, 14
# Priority: medium
# Description: Implement comprehensive error handling and user feedback throughout the Flutter app
# Details:
Create global error handling service using Flutter's error handling mechanisms. Implement user-friendly error messages for common failures. Create a toast or snackbar notification system for feedback using Flutter's material components. Implement offline error handling with retry options using connectivity packages. Add error logging for debugging with packages like logger or sentry. Create feedback collection for user-reported issues. Implement graceful degradation for feature unavailability.

# Test Strategy:
Test error handling with simulated failures in various app functions using Flutter's testing framework. Verify user-friendly messages are displayed appropriately with widget tests. Test offline error handling and retry functionality with integration tests. Ensure error logging works correctly for debugging purposes.
