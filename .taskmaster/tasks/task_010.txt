# Task ID: 10
# Title: Chef Avatar UI Component
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the pop-up chef avatar that appears during assistant interactions
# Details:
Design animated chef avatar with different states (idle, listening, speaking, thinking) using Flutter animations. Implement pop-up animation for avatar appearance and dismissal with Flutter's animation controllers. Create speech bubble or text display for assistant responses using Flutter widgets. Implement avatar state management based on interaction context using Flutter state management (Provider, Bloc, or Riverpod). Add subtle animations for improved user experience with Flutter's animation framework. Ensure avatar is non-intrusive but helpful during cooking process.

# Test Strategy:
Test avatar animations and state transitions using Flutter widget tests. Verify avatar correctly responds to different interaction states with integration tests. Test avatar on different screen sizes to ensure proper scaling and positioning using Flutter's device preview or test on various emulators.
