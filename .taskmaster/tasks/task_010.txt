# Title: Chef Avatar UI Component
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 8
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the pop-up chef avatar that appears during assistant interactions
# Details:
Design animated chef avatar with different states (idle, listening, speaking, thinking). Implement pop-up animation for avatar appearance and dismissal. Create speech bubble or text display for assistant responses. Implement avatar state management based on interaction context. Add subtle animations for improved user experience. Ensure avatar is non-intrusive but helpful during cooking process.

# Test Strategy:
Test avatar animations and state transitions. Verify avatar correctly responds to different interaction states. Test avatar on different screen sizes to ensure proper scaling and positioning.
