# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 3, 5
# Priority: high
# Description: Create the onboarding experience for new users to collect preferences and experience level
# Details:
Design multi-step onboarding flow with progress indicator using Flutter widgets. Create screens for: cooking experience selection (beginner, intermediate, advanced), dietary restrictions selection (gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian, etc.), food preferences input, purpose for downloading, and referral source. Implement data collection and storage in Supabase using the Supabase Flutter SDK. Create skip functionality for optional steps. Implement onboarding completion tracking with shared preferences or Supabase.

# Test Strategy:
Test complete onboarding flow with various user inputs using Flutter widget tests and integration tests. Verify all user preferences are correctly saved to the database. Test skipping optional steps. Ensure onboarding can be completed successfully. Use Flutter's test framework to validate UI components and state management.
