# Task ID: 23
# Title: Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16, 17, 18
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize app performance for smooth user experience across devices
# Details:
Implement lazy loading for images and heavy content using Flutter's lazy loading mechanisms. Create efficient lists with ListView.builder or CustomScrollView for large data sets. Optimize API calls with caching and batching using packages like dio and hive. Implement memory management for media resources with proper disposal of controllers and streams. Add performance monitoring for key user interactions using DevTools and custom performance overlays. Optimize animations and transitions with Flutter's built-in animation system. Implement deferred components for faster initial load.

# Test Strategy:
Measure and compare performance metrics before and after optimization using Flutter DevTools. Test app on low-end devices to ensure acceptable performance. Monitor memory usage during extended app usage with Flutter's memory profiler. Verify smooth scrolling and transitions in all lists and screens using Flutter Performance overlay.
