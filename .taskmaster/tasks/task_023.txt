# Task ID: 23
# Title: Performance Optimization
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 16, 17, 18
# Priority: medium
# Description: Optimize app performance for smooth user experience across devices
# Details:
Implement lazy loading for images and heavy content. Create virtualized lists for large data sets. Optimize API calls with caching and batching. Implement memory management for media resources. Add performance monitoring for key user interactions. Optimize animations and transitions. Implement code splitting for faster initial load.

# Test Strategy:
Measure and compare performance metrics before and after optimization. Test app on low-end devices to ensure acceptable performance. Monitor memory usage during extended app usage. Verify smooth scrolling and transitions in all lists and screens.
