# Task ID: 17
# Title: Search Screen Implementation
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 11, 12
# Priority: medium
# Description: Create the search screen for manually browsing or filtering recipes
# Details:
Design search screen with search bar and filter options using Flutter widgets. Implement text-based recipe search functionality with Dart. Create advanced filtering by ingredient, tool, dietary need, difficulty, and time using Flutter's filtering components. Implement search history tracking with shared preferences or local database. Add popular searches or trending recipes section. Create UI for displaying search results in list and grid views using ListView.builder and GridView.builder. Implement infinite scrolling for large result sets using ScrollController or packages like infinite_scroll_pagination.

# Test Strategy:
Test search with various queries and filter combinations using Flutter widget tests and integration tests. Verify search results match query and filter criteria. Test search history functionality with unit tests. Ensure infinite scrolling works correctly with large result sets using Flutter Driver tests.
