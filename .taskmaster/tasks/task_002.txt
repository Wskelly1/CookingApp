# Task ID: 2
# Title: Supabase Backend Integration
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 1
# Priority: high
# Description: Set up Supabase project and configure authentication and database services
# Details:
Create a new Supabase project. Configure authentication with email/password sign-up and sign-in. Set up database tables for user profiles, preferences, saved recipes, and progress tracking. Create necessary database schemas with appropriate relationships. Implement Row Level Security (RLS) policies for data protection. Generate API keys and configure environment variables for the React Native app.

# Test Strategy:
Test authentication flow with sample user accounts. Verify database operations (CRUD) for all tables. Ensure RLS policies correctly restrict access to user data.
