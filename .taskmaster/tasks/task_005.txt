# Task ID: 5
# Title: Authentication and User Management
# Status: pending
# Dependencies: 2, 4
# Priority: high
# Description: Implement user authentication flow including sign-up, sign-in, and password recovery
# Details:
Create authentication screens (sign-up, sign-in, forgot password) using Flutter widgets. Implement form validation for all authentication inputs using Flutter's form validation. Connect authentication forms to Supabase auth services using the Supabase Flutter SDK. Implement secure token storage and refresh mechanism with Flutter Secure Storage. Create authentication state management using Provider or Riverpod for global auth state. Implement sign-out functionality. Add error handling and user feedback for authentication processes with Flutter snackbars or dialogs.

# Test Strategy:
Test complete authentication flow including sign-up, sign-in, and password recovery. Verify form validation works correctly. Test token refresh mechanism. Ensure proper error handling for authentication failures. Write widget tests for authentication screens and integration tests for the full authentication flow.
