Create a new React Native project using the latest CLI version with TypeScript support. Configure project structure following best practices with directories for components, screens, assets, navigation, and utils. Set up ESLint, Prettier, and TypeScript for code quality. Initialize Git repository and create initial commit. Configure environment variables for development, staging, and production environments. Set up shadcn component library integration for consistent UI components. Install and configure navigation and async storage dependencies.
